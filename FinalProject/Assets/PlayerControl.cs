    /* **************Explanation and Hints************
     * Rigidbody - When attached to a GameObject it adds things like gravity as well as other physics properties to the GameObject.
     *             For the player we want to attach the Rigidbody to it so that we can add a forward force to it when pressing the up arrow key
     *           - To use the Rigidbody we need a variable. The type of this variable is "Rigidbody" instead of "int" and often this variable
     *             is named "rigidbody".
     *           - Now we need to get the reference to the Rigidbody. If we don't then it won't work. In order to get the reference we need to
     *             type " *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* = GetComponentComponent<Rigidbody>(); " in the Start function. Replace *nameOfRigidbodyVariable*
     *             with whatever name you gave the rigidbody variable.
     *             
     * Key inputs - In order to detect key presses Unity has a special Object called Input. We will have to put this Input object as a conditional
     *              of an if statement. We do this so that when a key is pressed it will only run the code in the if statement. Input also has to
     *              be in the Update function. So if we wanted to detect the left arrow key we would type the following in the Update function:
     *              "if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftArrow))
     *              {
     *                  //Put here what you want the left arrow to do
     *              }"
     *              
     * Rotation - To rotate the player we need to use a function in the Transform object. Transform contains all of the variables and functions
     *            relating to a GameObject's position and rotation. So if we want the player to turn left or right we would type the following.
     *            " transform.Rotate(new Vector3(0, *rotationSpeedVariable*, 0); ". Replace *rotationSpeedVariable* with whatever variable you
     *            are using for the rotation speed.
     *            
     * Forward movement - There are many ways to move a GameObject but in this instance we will use the AddRelativeForce function. That function
     *                    is a part of the Rigidbody component. AddRelativeForce adds a force in a direction relative to the rotation of the
     *                    GameObject. Also, make sure that the Rigidbody variable has a reference or else Unity will throw an error. So to add
     *                    forward movement to the player we need to type the following:
     *                    " *nameOfRigidbodyVariable*.AddRelativeForce(0, 0, *movementSpeedVariable*); ". Replace *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* with
     *                    the name of the Rigidbody variable and replace *movementSpeedVariable* with the name of the movement speed variable.

	/* **************Explanation and Hints************ 
	* Prefab - They are GameObjects that are stored outside of the scene. We use them to instantiate      
	*          GameObjects. 
	*
	* Instantiate - This will create a new GameObject or prefab of our choosing. In this script we want to
	*               create bullets. We will create the bullets at the players position and we will
	*               have the bullet match the rotation of the player. To do so we will type:
	*             
	*               Instantiate(*nameOfBulletVariable*, transform.position, transform.rotation);
	*
	* Pressing Space Bar - When shooting we want to use a different key press then the others. For this we
	*                      will be using Input.GetKeyDown. The reason why is because GetKeyDown only activates
	*                      once while GetKey activates multiple times. GetKeyDown is typed like this:
	*              
	*                      if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
	*                      {
	*                          //Instantiate bullet here
